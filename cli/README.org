* todo:
- [X] figure out how you wanna do display ids
  - maybe redraw them each time ls is run and set all that are not included to 0
- [ ] split data.json into 2 different files - one for complete tasks and one for incomplete
  - all tasks disp_id are based on their order in the incomplete file
  - when a task is moved from incomplete to complete, it loses its disp id
- [X] use serde for serialize/deserialize
- [X] figure out a way for task statuses to be changed. reflect this in clap_def and rough man
- [ ] in the status config, have a way to order status so you can order tasks by status ie urg then todo then backlog etc
- [X] figure out how to reflect that (some) add, (some) list, and (some) edit subcommands accept sentence args.
- [ ] undo previous action (have a file that contains a description of the last action that can be rolled back)
* known bugs:
- [X] clap errors on command with no args eg 'rask t' or 'rask s'. not sure why
- [X] data.json clears itself when app ungracefully exits
- [X] don't allow multiple statuses
* future:
- [ ] `rask info <id>` see all the metadata on a task, pretty
- [ ] clap autocomplete
- [ ] modify tasks in a group (similiar to task warrior)
  - e.g. task mod s:urgent +john mister | @school
    - select all tasks that have an urgent status, john tag, and contain the string "mister" and add them to the schoo group
- [X] make specifiers have colors in list output eg all g:group is red and +tag is blue etc
  - maybe have these colors in the discription instead of having a column for tag and group?
* features:
- [ ] namespace definitions like taskwarrior
- [ ] task recurrence similar to ultralist, but with more options like mon, tues, etc
- [ ] when editing, you may append to a task or override it
- [ ] due dates and times (date:12dec time:12:30am)
- [ ] .raskrc (maybe store some info there like statuses and namespaces)
  - maybe: make a default status config exist, but can be changed. different donestates and todostates like org agenda!
* notes:
- + or t: for tags
# - @ or n: for namespaces | EDIT: namespaces are now defined with tags and/or a due date or something like that
- @ or g: for status
- % or s: for group
* ~/.config/rask/raskrc:
- status config (multiple done/todo states)
- namespace config
- themes
- default due time if no due time specified
* rough man
